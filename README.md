# ANSI CL

ANSI Common Lisp combines an introduction to Lisp programming, and a convenient,
up-to-date reference manual for ANSI Common Lisp. Beginners will find that its
careful explanations and interesting examples make Lisp programming easy to
learn. Professional programmers will appreciate its thorough, practical approach.

Information about the book and the corresponding courses may be found at http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html

In this repo, I'm working through the exercises as a way to learn the language and see what all the Lisp love is about.
